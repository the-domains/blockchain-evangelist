  We ( Seedcamp) recently hosted a Legal Tech focused event in partnership with
  Next Law Labs to bring together influencers in the Legal Tech community and
  those interested in finding out more. The turnout for the event was great and
  speaking to the founders who came along it really feels like the space is at a
  tipping point.
